                                What would art look like in a liberated world? A revolutionary one? Historically, Marxist conversations about the literature and the arts have centered on questions about art’s role building counter-ideologies to capitalism in socialist societies, or about whether art objects are commodities in capitalist society. But what about post-socialism, or the capitalism of declining profitability. Our panelists are using Marx to understand literature and art in new ways, approaching them as values, rather than commodities or expressions of ideologies per se. Their ideas are theoretical, but also grounded in real places and times — in the aftermath of state socialism in the former Soviet Union, for instance, or in what used to be called the global “periphery” of Latin America.

                                <p>Luk&aacute;cs again? That dimly recalled precursor of Adorno and Benjamin who ended up as a Stalinist hack? In his magisterial new book, <em>Luk&aacute;cs: Praxis and the Absolute</em>, Daniel Andr&eacute;s L&oacute;pez gives us a Lukacs for our time, reassembling his 1920s philosophy into a conceptual-historical totality and offering a speculative reading that both defends Luk&aacute;cs and proposes an unprecedented, immanent critique. If his concept of praxis approaches the shape of Hegel's Absolute but ultimately fails to bear its weight, it raises crucial political, methodological and philosophical questions for Marxism that still resonate. (Plus, how many Ministers of Culture have actually scoured aristocratic mansions in search of hidden-away Old Master paintings to be transferred to a public museum?) Red May has brought together a stellar panel of thinkers well-versed in the Lukacsian era&mdash;Esther Leslie, biographer of Benjamin, and Andrew Feenberg, author of <em>The Philosophy of Praxis&mdash;</em>to discuss this essential book. Reification, anyone?</p>

                                The communist project in the twentieth century grew out of utopian desires to oppose oppression and abolish class structures, to give individual lives collective meaning. The attempts to realize these ideals became a series of colossal failures. In her new book, Yesterday's Tomorrow, Bini Adamczak examines these catastrophes: the Hitler-Stalin Pact, the Great Terror of 1937, the failure of the European Left to prevent National Socialism, Stalin's rise to power, and the bloody rebellion at Kronstadt. Turning our heads away from these events, she argues, wishing to keep our utopia “free of past slaughter…lionizing only those revolutionaries who perished before they could make it far enough,” is a way of confirming that “all (we) want to do is dream, not triumph.” In contrast, she seeks traces of the future that never happened. “To bury the past’s struggles for the future means nothing more, under the ongoing conditions of defeat, than burying the future itself—that is, another future.” Michael Hardt joins the author in conversation.

                                <p>&ldquo;In the last decade or so,&rdquo; writes Gean Moreno, &ldquo;the lockstep incursion of flat ontologies, notions of quasi-sentient matter, slime-lined and mushroom-sprouting vitalisms, and network-everything into contemporary art discourse and exhibitions has been hard to miss. Embraced with steady fanfare, a slushy and exhilaratingly immoderate carnival of chemistry and composting&hellip;has us querying the unfathomable inexhaustibility of objects, their capacity to pipeline unwieldy forces and transgress the tiny territory of the real available to human access.&rdquo; In opposition to this mystifying trend, some artists, critics, curators, and theorists have been drawing on the critique of political economy to mobilize the concept of &ldquo;real abstraction&rdquo;(originally developed by Alfred Sohn-Rethel, recently updated by Alberto Toscano) for contemporary cultural production. Let&rsquo;s talk to a few.</p>

                                Bordertowns came into existence when the first US military forts and trading posts were strategically placed along expanding imperial frontiers to extinguish indigenous resistance and incorporate captured indigenous territories into the burgeoning nation-state. To this day, the US settler state continues to wage violence on Native life and land in these spaces out of desperation to eliminate the threat of Native presence and complete its vision of national consolidation “from sea to shining sea.” This explains why some of the most important Native-led rebellions in US history originated in bordertowns and why they are zones of ongoing confrontation between Native nations and their colonial occupier, the United States. Two of the authors of Red Nation Rising, the first book ever to investigate and explain the violent dynamics of bordertowns, talk to Chris LaTray.

                                As we face cascading crises caused by the extractive systems that still determine the material conditions of our lives, mutual aid is proliferating and drawing more people into resistance work. The growth of mutual aid projects, alongside the worsening climate crisis, the brutal failures of government responses to COVID-19 (particularly under the US a for-profit healthcare system), and the increasing calls for border, police, and prison abolition are surfacing long-standing debates about the role of government in producing and responding to crises. This panel conversation will explore these questions using the current moment as a jumping off point.

                                Red May knows what you want: a theoretically informed take on the current moment. That’s why when we hear the word ‘conjuncture’, we reach for our copy of the ‘Brooklyn Rail’ and turn to the section called ‘Field Notes,’ or check it out online. We’re happy to present the editor of that section (Paul) and one of his frequent contributors (Jason) in a wide-ranging conversation that may start or end with Marx but can go, well, anywhere.

                            </p>
                            <p>During the last decades, new readings of Marx have stressed his analysis of form and fetishism, which played only a minor role in most traditional versions of Marxism. Such readings, however, provoked complaints that they would diminish--or even obscure--the political thrust of the Marxian critique. Focusing on the &ldquo;logic&rdquo; of abstract categories, so the argument went, would replace the ongoing inquiry into class and class struggle. In this talk, Michael Heinrich, author of <em>The Science of Value</em> and, currently, of a major multi-volume biography of Marx, <em>Karl Marx and the Birth of Modern Society, </em>will discuss the political dimension of Marx&rsquo;s form analysis, showing that it has consequences not only for our understanding of class but also for our conception of the bourgeois state and, indeed, of socialism itself. Red May is thrilled to host a talk by one of the leading lights of the <em>Neue Marx-Lekt&uuml;re</em>.</p>

                                <p>Red May celebrates the publication of Red Media&rsquo;s first book,&nbsp;<em>The Red Deal: Indigenous Action to Save Our Earth</em>. Authored by two dozen Indigenous revolutionaries,&nbsp;<em>The Red Deal</em>&nbsp;is a political program for liberation that emerges from the oldest class struggle in the Americas&mdash;the Indigenous fight for decolonization. Offering a profound vision for a decolonized society,&nbsp;The Red Deal&nbsp;is not simply a response to the Green New Deal nor a &ldquo;bargain&rdquo; with the elite and powerful. It is a deal with the humble people of the earth; an affirmation that colonialism and capitalism must be overturned for human and other-than-human life to live with dignity. It is a pact with movements for liberation, life, and land for a new world of peace and justice that must come from below and to the left. Join five authors from The Red Nation for a conversation about the book and its significance.&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>How is the concept of working-class autonomy — from capitalism and the state apparatus, from the official organizations of the Left (political parties, nonprofit organizations, progressive religious groups, foundations, etc.) — indebted to Black and Brown liberation movements?  To begin to answer this question, we will revisit the early conversations between CLR James and others about the “autonomy” of black liberation, intertwining of black liberation struggles and autonomist worker organizing in the lives and work of Grace Lee and Jimmy Boggs, and the relationships between black autoworkers and autonomists in Italy.</p>

                                What would a modern-day communist program look like? We all have different ideas about where to focus our finite energies: some look to trade unions; some to workers' self-organization; some to core groups of militants; others to mass organizations. Base-building tendencies beg the question: base for what? We increasingly come up against the limits of 'economic' struggles as the state goes to greater lengths to repress us. The pandemic has made these questions more urgent, but if you don't think the democratic party will save us, what are we proposing instead? AngryWorkers, a collective from the UK who work in bigger workplaces with the aim of doing workers' enquiries will talk about how to stir up shit at work, while experimenting with different models of working class organization.

                                The future of work looks bleak. We face major crises that call for radical responses. What kinds of demands leading to what kinds of futures do we both need and want? Should a basic income be one part of this future, as at once a way to address the current problem of precarity and as a path towards greater freedom? What about the future of aging and the organization of care? How, in the face of environmental collapse, can we address current problems while, at the same time, opening onto a more utopian horizon?

                                What are the relations between gender and labour? What pressures, oppressions and state persecutions are faced by trans people living in capitalist societies? How are these antagonisms structured within society? How do gender non-conforming people survive the damage done through their tenuous position in the workplace and the home? How can they mobilize strong emphatic responses to right-wing scaremongering against 'gender ideology?' Red May welcomes editors and contributors to the important new anthology, Transgender Marxism, which argues that to achieve trans liberation, capitalism must be abolished.

                                Born and raised in Alabama, James Boggs came to Detroit during the Great Migration, becoming an automobile worker and a union activist. Grace Lee was a Chinese American scholar who studied Hegel, worked with Caribbean political theorist C. L. R. James, and moved to Detroit to work toward a new American revolution. As husband and wife, the couple was influential in the early stages of what would become the Black Power movement, laying the intellectual foundation for racial and urban struggles during one of the most active social movement periods in recent U.S. history. Taking Stephen Ward’s dual biography of these two crucial figures as a point of departure, the author and the panel will discuss the intellectual strain of black radicalism shaped by Boggses and their rightful place in postwar American history.

                                Continuing a discussion initiated around Alberto Toscano’s ‘The State of the Pandemic’, (Historical Materialism, Volume 28, Issue 4), the panel will try to map some of the ways in which the Covid-19 pandemic (and the looming climate emergency) further intensifies a crisis in the functions and the perception of the state, revealing the contradictions in both mainstream and radical ideologies. A desire for the state as guarantor of public welfare vies with fear of its hypertrophic capacities for surveillance and control. Is an epidemiological politics from below, beyond the plague state, possible? Can recent emergency measures be seen as incomplete or inverted anticipations of a communist use of the state of exception? Or is the primacy of the political we are currently experiencing a mere fetish, indissociable from the rule of capital?

                                From Spinoza's Theological Political Treatise to Wilhelm Reich's Mass Psychology of Fascism to Deleuze and Guattari's Anti-Oedipus, one of the most fundamental and most disturbing questions of politics has been: why do people fight for their servitude as if it were their salvation? The strange thing isn't that some people steal or occasionally go on strike, but that hungry people don't always steal, and workers aren't always on strike. This question has always had to address the existence of something like the "far right": from monarchist tyranny to fascism to "democratic" authoritarianism. Today as the left debates the utility of the word "fascism," the staying power of Trumpism, the meaning of right-wing populism, join us for an open-ended discussion on what it means for people to fight for their own servitude.

                            <p><em>Confessions of the Fox</em> is a formally experimental novel, combining fiction, metafiction, critical theory and archival sources to re- envision the life of notorious prison-break artist, Jack Sheppard (1702-1724), who was also the inspiration for Bertolt Brecht&rsquo;s 1928 <em>Threepenny Opera</em> and John Gay&rsquo;s 1728 <em>Beggar&rsquo;s Opera</em>. Rosenberg's retelling draws out the previously unremarked extent to which representations of Sheppard as sexually deviant were central to his crafting as an icon of resistance. Building on the history of sexology, prison records, early-modern memoir, jailhouse confessions, and the birth of British policing and colonial projects, Confessions' version of Sheppard&rsquo;s life&nbsp; doubles as an explicitly fictionalized and speculative history of queer and trans sexuality. In this sense, the novel both creates a narrative life-world for readers to imagine and to connect with alternate histories of sex and gender, as well as presents and proposes an innovative methodology for working with &ndash; and pushing the boundaries of &ndash; the official archives.</p>

Heather Berg&rsquo;s new book,&nbsp;<em>Porn Work,</em>&nbsp;takes readers behind the scenes to explore what porn performers think of their work and how they intervene to hack it. Blending extensive fieldwork with feminist and anti-work theorizing,&nbsp;<em>Porn Work</em>&nbsp;details entrepreneurial labor on the boundaries between pleasure and tedium. Rejecting any notion that sex work is an aberration from straight work, it reveals porn workers' creative strategies as prophetic of a working landscape in crisis. In the end, it looks to what porn has to tell us about what's wrong with work, and what it might look like to build something better.</p>

                                What does the development of a truly robust contemporary theory of domination require? Ashley J. Bohrer’s new book, Marxism and Intersectionality, argues that it is only by considering all of the dimensions of race, gender, sexuality, and class within the structures of capitalism and imperialism that we can understand power relations as we find them nowadays. Bohrer explains how many of the purported incompatibilities between Marxism and intersectionality arise more from miscommunication rather than a fundamental conceptual antagonism. Taking her book as a point of departure, let’s discuss what kind of tools are available to work against the multiple systems of domination, exploitation, and oppression that we find ourselves implicated with.

                                <p>What exactly are the economic shifts that have driven the social transformations taking place in Anglo-capitalist societies? Lisa Adkins and Martijn Konings argue that growing inequality is a product of the rise of an &lsquo;asset economy&rsquo;.&nbsp;Decades of property inflation have seen asset ownership overshadow employment as a determinant of class position. In their new book,&nbsp;<em>The Asset Economy</em>, co-authored with Melinda Cooper, they explore the harmful effects of the Fed&rsquo;s policy of Quantitative Easing and similar asset-supporting measures on a range of phenomena that are&nbsp;widely debated but often poorly understood: redistributions&nbsp;of wealth, precarity, the dynamics of land use, changes in fiscal and monetary policy, the dilemmas of &ldquo;millennials&rdquo;, and the rise of a&nbsp;speculative imperative as a social logic&mdash;a demand that one speculate merely to keep from falling further down the social ladder. Despite widespread awareness of the&nbsp;harmful&nbsp;effects of Quantitative Easing,&nbsp;we appear to have entered an era of policy &ldquo;lock-in&rdquo; that is responsible for a volatile disconnect between popular expectations and institutional priorities.&nbsp; Steven Shaviro joins the conversation</p>

Rarely do they assess Marxian concepts from the standpoint of the ‘production of subjectivity” and their potential for grasping the present from the standpoint of a radical transformation that pushes Marx beyond Marxism. Two theorists who do—who admire each other’s works but have never been in dialogue before—explore the changed landscape of contemporary capitalism and the process of revolutionary subjectivation.

                                <p>The Constitution as a weapon? But what else has it been since Capital hijacked the 14th amendment to establish corporate personhood rather than, as intended, to protect newly freed slaves? State power, as Poulantzas notes, is best conceived not as a functionalist organogram of fixed institutions and powers but as a field any point of which can be occupied by a ruling class threatened from below. Exhibit A and B? Chile and the United States, where the judicial power has acted as the immovable agent of minority rule. The institutional conflict between Capital and power from below is coming to a head in both countries. A constitutional convention will be held in Chile. Camila Vergara, author of <em>Systemic Corruption: Constitutional Ideas for an Anti-Oligarchic Republic</em>, discusses the constitutional neoliberal model in Chile and the emergence of an organic council system aimed at radically changing it &lsquo;from below&rsquo;. Aziz Rana&rsquo;s forthcoming book, <em>Rise of the Constitution</em>, explores the genesis of the U.S.'s reverential approach to its federal constitution and how veneration acts as a brake on radical change. Richard Kreitner, author of <em>Break it Up, Secession, Division, and the Secret History of America&rsquo;s Imperfect Union</em>, shows how fragmentation and polarization are constants in US history, and asks how long a democratic majority should put up with transparently unfair constitutional devices used to entrench minority rule.</p>

                                There are decades where nothing happens, as Lenin said, and then there are years when decades happen. The collapse of the Sanders campaign in the days between Nevada and South Carolina. The explosion of the Pandemic. The George Floyd Rebellion. The double overtime electoral contest. The neofascist Capitol riot. How many decades have we lived in the last year without ever having the space to process what was happening? RED MAY thinks that even at the risk of superficiality, the cumulative effect of these successive punches hasn't received the attention it deserved. So where are we now?

                            <p>A discussion between Dr. Jodi Dean and Dr. Charisse Burden-Stelly,&nbsp;moderated by Dr. Ashley Farmer, about their forthcoming Verso edited collection,&nbsp;<em>Organize, Fight, Win: Three Decades of Black Communist Women's Political Writing.&nbsp;</em>This pathbreaking work is the first of its kind to bring together the writings of Black Communist and Communist-adjacent women, including&nbsp;Grace Campbell, Williana Burroughs, Louise Thompson Patterson, Esther Cooper Jackson, Claudia Jones, Vicki Garvin, Eslanda Goode Robeson, Lorraine Hansberry, and Charlotta Bass into a single volume.&nbsp;<em>Organize, Fight, Win&nbsp;</em>aims to expose activists, organizers, and scholars&nbsp;committed to internationalist anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist, anti-sexist, and Black liberation struggle to the ways that these women&rsquo;s political writing consistently linked specific issues to international, historical, and structural patterns. The conversation will highlight how Dean and Burden-Stelly came to the project; some of the authors' favorite pieces; the major themes and topics of the volume; and the importance of Black communist women's writing for our current moment.</p>

                                This year marks the 150th anniversary of the Paris Commune, doubtless the defining episode in early Marxist thinking about popular power. What lessons does the Commune still hold for us in the context of deepening global revolt? Red May has invited Spectre Journal to organize a special panel and they have brought together two leading analysts who will discuss its multiple legacies – communist, feminist, anarchist, abolitionist, and beyond—and assess the meaning of the Commune today.

What prompted them to embark on this project? What do they hope that their revised version will be able to bring out in the text that existing versions don’t? What difficulties have they encountered along the way?

                                1969. A young worker from the South arrives at Fiat’s Mirafiori factory in Turin. The work sucks. The bosses withhold his wages.  His complexion begins to fade from the fourteen-hour workdays. Result: a wave of continuous strikes shut down the factory. Barricades line the roads, tear gas wafts into private homes, and the slogan “We Want Everything” is ringing through the streets. Nanni Balestrini’s novel of Italy’s ‘Hot Autumn’ and its decade of revolt has lost none of its edge.

                                What is the relationship between Marx's theory of value and communism? Drawing upon thinkers such as Amadeo Bordiga and Gilles Dauvé, for whom "the whole of Marx's work was a description of communism," Jasper Bernes has proposed a new way of understanding the tasks of communism in practice and in theory. In Marx, and in the few thinkers who have attempted to apply his thought directly to the practical task of communism, we can find a "test of communism," a logical model of the necessary conditions for communism, which implies an adequate concept of capitalism. The panel will bring together new research on the theory of value, the theory of the state, and the history of the communist movement, in order to begin a wider discussion about the prospects for communism in the twenty-first century.

Against the grain of a traditional orthodoxy that can only see uprisings as constituent processes, destitution offers us a perspective from which we can weigh the contemporary wave of revolts on their own terms, beyond the horizon of representation.</p>

                                What possibilities are there in our moment for a reflection on Marx? On Asia or ‘Asia’ as a figure of discourse? And what of the relation of Marx and Asia, Marx in Asia, Marxism as a mode of comprehending the actuality of Asia in the contemporary moment? What broader theoretical reflections – on time, history, the ‘becoming’ of capitalism, the possibilities of politics in our era, and the fleeting object of analysis that is the present – can this relation open up? Which Marx do we need today? What politics of history, of the present, of the world? A conversation that began online in issue number 3 of the journal, Episteme continues at Red May across the landscape of the historical present.

In this way, critical theory is de-provincialized, meeting Bol&iacute;var Echeverr&iacute;a and Adolfo S&aacute;nchez V&aacute;zquez; and it branches out further in its encounter with contemporary social and political movements and theories, including feminism and gendered dynamics of social reproduction.

                                This panel mobilizes personal witness and path-breaking scholarly research to confront the problem of our time: the police. More specifically, the police as a group. Since Ferguson, the internet has disseminated iPhone videos of murders by individual cops. Only rarely do we see, as we did for the entire month of the George Floyd Uprising, what happens when a lot of cops assemble together and metamorphose into an autonomous strike force, with no more allegiance to anything outside of itself than the Freikorps in Weimar Germany or the mercenary companies who marauded through Renaissance Italy. If this is the wrong kind of group (as we all think it is) — a sociopathic group, in fact — then simply cutting some funding or removing bad apples doesn't address the problem. What actions would address the problem and how do we make them happen?

                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In discussions of the importance of&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">personal</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;debt to the reproduction of capital and the management of surplus populations, the metaphor of haunting and (re)possession is not uncommon: debt is like a vengeful ghost, terrorizing and commandeering those in its grasp. What, though, of&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">common</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;debts, owed not by individuals but by cities, nations, institutions, corporations and collectivities? In Capital I, Marx writes: "The only part of the so-called national wealth that actually enters into the collective possessions of modern peoples is their national debt&hellip; [which] becomes the&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">credo</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;of capital&hellip;. want of faith in the national debt takes the place of the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which may not be forgiven.&rdquo; The success with which neoliberal and neoconservative politicians wield fears about government debts as a justification for austerity (i.e. class war) confirms the powerful hold of these phantoms - public debts, indeed, are a&nbsp;&ldquo;collective possession." But if, as Marx suggests, this debt is also a &ldquo;collective possession,&rdquo; how might it also be a platform or a starting point for reimagining collective power in financialized times? From the abstract language of the social bonds that intertwine us all to concrete demands for reparations for the stolen wealth on which nations and institutions were built, can a notion of collective debt open horizons beyond capitalism? What forms of struggle emerge under conditions of collective indebtedness, for good and for ill? Can a &ldquo;we&rdquo; powerful enough to abolish capitalism crystallize around a notion of collective debt, either a debt owed to &ldquo;us&rdquo; or one that we owe?</span></p>

                                There are decades where nothing happens, as Lenin said, and then there are years when decades happen. The collapse of the Sanders campaign in the days between Nevada and South Carolina. The explosion of the Pandemic. The George Floyd Rebellion. The double overtime electoral contest. The neofascist Capitol riot. How many decades have we lived in the last year without ever having the space to process what was happening? RED MAY thinks that even at the risk of superficiality, the cumulative effect of these successive punches hasn't received the attention it deserved. So where are we now?

                            <p>Mahmood Mamdani&rsquo;s new book argues that the nation-state and the colonial state created each other through the politicization of a religious or ethnic majority at the expense of an equally manufactured minority. The model emerged in North America, where genocide and internment on reservations created both a permanent native underclass and the physical and ideological spaces in which new immigrant identities crystallized as a settler nation. In Europe, this template would be used by the Nazis to address the Jewish Question, and after the fall of the Third Reich, by the Allies to redraw the boundaries of Eastern Europe&rsquo;s nation-states, cleansing them of their minorities. After Nuremberg, the template was used to preserve the idea of the Jews as a separate nation. By establishing Israel through the minoritization of Palestinian Arabs, Zionist settlers followed the North American example. The result has been another cycle of violence. But what would it take to create a political community that moves beyond our <em>Herrenvolk</em> democracies to a world with neither settlers nor natives?</p>

                                <p>The Cultural Revolution in China remains one of the most controversial and provocative historical episodes, from the United States to China itself. Yet the "thorough negation" of the Cultural Revolution has made it impossible to truly think through what happened in the global&nbsp;1960s, and to understand the trajectory of the major 20th century revolutions. With Alessandro Russo's recent book <em>Cultural Revolution and Revolutionary Culture</em> as its starting point, this panel proposes to seriously confront not only the failures and tragedies of the Cultural Revolution, but also what was politically at stake in this historical moment on a global scale, posing once again the questions that defined this moment: What organizational forms does&nbsp;emancipatory politics take? How is emancipatory politics limited by the party and the state? What happens when its organizational forms become exhausted? Finally, what are the possibilities and risks of the transition to a world beyond capitalism?</p>

                            In a year of massive feminist mobilizations in virtually every continent, overturning social mores and repressive legislation, the women’s strike, as both a concept and collective experience, may be transforming the boundaries of politics as we know it.
        Verónica Gago, one of the leaders of the emerging Feminist International joins Kathi Weeks and Michael Hardt to explore ongoing debates in feminist and Marxist theory: from social reproduction and domestic work to the intertwining of financial and gender violence, as well as controversies surrounding the neo-extractivist model of development, the possibilities and limits of left populism, and the ever-vexed nexus of gender-race-class. What would another theory of power might look like, one premised on our desire to change everything?

                                <p>The gambit of&nbsp;<em>Marx for Cats: A Radical Bestiary&nbsp;</em>is that the history of capitalism may be narrated through the feline and that doing so reveals a heretofore unacknowledged animality at the heart of Marx&rsquo;s critique and subsequent generations of Marxist critique.&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Marxist and Marx&rsquo;s writing, as well as a substantial visual archive of paintings, prints, and photographs, each chapter of this talk stages a confrontation between the mode of production and cats to reveal that not only is &ldquo;all history the history of class struggle&rdquo; as Marx and Engels so rightly claimed, but that &ldquo;all history is the history of cat struggle,&rdquo; too.&nbsp;</p>

                                Repulsive and yet strangely attractive, the gimmick is a form that can be found virtually everywhere in capitalism. It comes in many guises: a musical hook, a financial strategy, a striptease, a novel of ideas. Above all, argues Sianne Ngai, the gimmick strikes us both as working too little (a labor-saving trick) and as working too hard (a strained effort to get our attention). Focusing on this connection to work in her new book on the theoretical dimensions of the Gimmick, Ngai draws a line from gimmicks to political economy. When we call something a gimmick, we are registering uncertainties about value bound to labor and time―misgivings that indicate broader anxieties about the measurement of wealth in capitalism. Poet and critic Christopher Nealon joins the author on an expedition to track this elusive form across a landscape of theory, fiction, photography, and video.
